# Data Preparation:
The dataset includes information about product sales, and all other relevant metrics. Ensure that you import the data into Power BI and perform any necessary data cleaning and transformation to make it suitable for analysis.

# Dashboard Creation:
Create a Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations that provide insights into the dataset. Include relevant charts, graphs, and tables to present the data in a meaningful and actionable way.

The dashboard should have sections that address specific aspects of the marketing stream data, such as campaign performance, sales trends, conversion rates, click through rates, returns of the spends. 

# Analysis:
Showcase your analytical skills by identifying patterns, trends, and correlations in the data. Generate insights and recommendations based on your analysis.

Provide explanations for any significant findings in the data and suggest possible actions that could be taken based on those insights.
